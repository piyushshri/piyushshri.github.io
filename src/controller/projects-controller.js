            <li>Literature study, design and implementation of dynamic Business Process Model (BPM) designing web application adhering to the BPMN 2.0 standard using Activiti BPMN engine</li>
            <li>Enabled configurable connections to remote machines to run business process models remotely</li>
            <li>Worked on implementing custom activities to run programs (R, Python, Shell) within the business process models. Wrote behaviour classes, XML definitions and integration models for these activities</li>
            <li>Implemented file system workspace which enabled activities to use resources and scripts files stored both locally and remotely. Implemented the required features for workspace such as web sockets, queues, FTP pipelines etc</li>
            <li>Implemented versioning of workspace files using git</li>
            <li>Implemented validation of BPMN elements and thus reducing the chances of human errors while modeling.</li>
            <li>This helped the users save time as the bugs in their BP models could be pointed out at design phase rather than deployment phase</li>
